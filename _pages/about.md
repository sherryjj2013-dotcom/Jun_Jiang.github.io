Iâ€™m a PhD student at the Yale School of the Environment (YSE), advised by Dr. Michelle Bell and Dr. Arianna Salazar-Miranda. Before starting this journey, I earned my MPH at the Yale School of Public Health and my MLA at the University of Maryland.

I spend my days exploring how cities shape our health, using tools like spatial analysis, causal inference, and machine learning to understand how urban planning can create healthier, happier lives.

The UN predicts that by 2050, more than two-thirds of us will call cities home. Thatâ€™s a lot of neighbors! ðŸŒŽâœ¨ Are our cities ready for all of us? Maybe not yet, but that just means we still have time to dream bigger, plan smarter, and build better!
